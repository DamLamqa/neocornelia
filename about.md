## Koenraad Brosens
Project Cornelia's prime mover is Koenraad Brosens (1974). He is a Research Professor in the Art History Department of Leuven University. At the age of 9 he fell in love with the Commodore 64. Throughout his teens, his interest in computers never subsided. He started studying Computer Sciences at Leuven University, but then, for reasons unexplained, switched to Architecture. Since he liked the art history classes best, Koen swapped Architecture for Art History. As he developed his career as a tapestry historian, he almost completely forgot about his first love. An incident that involved his 4-year-old boy and his 3-D 'database' built with filing cards, post-it notes and woollen threads, however, redirected him to the computer.
