'Yes, but what does the name _mean_?’ There was a trace of exasperation in his voice. I had just explained the workings of our wonderful _Cornelia_ database, but clearly I had misunderstood his question. Assuming that _Cornelia_ was an acronym, he had only wanted to know its meaning. Instead I had given him a slightly boring ten-minute lecture on data cleaning, data modelling, data visualization, and the myriad possibilities of computational art history.

Klara came up with the name. As our database was growing fast, Astrid, Klara and I thought it would be fun to give it a name. So one Friday afternoon we had a brainstorm. I remember I vetoed acronyms. Our project had one (i.e., MapTap – Mapping the Antwerp-Brussels tapestry complex via network analysis 1600–1700) but only because the funding agencies needed one. I think there are way too many acronyms and most of them are dull and/ or far-fetched – thought there are exceptions. As the database was all about people, we started to list first names. I suggested Willem. I never tire of reading Willem Elsschot, and my partner and I called our son Willem. But Astrid and Klara, who did most of the testing and knew the database best, were convinced that the database was actually a young girl. As one of the goals of the project was to mitigate or even remove gender bias, I immediately agreed. Then I quickly shouted Johanna. I never tire of listening to Bob Dylan’s Visions of Johanna, and my partner and I would have called our baby Johanna if it had been a baby girl. One line goes ‘The ghost of ‘lectricity howls in the bones of her face’, and somehow I thought this really captured the spirit of the database. Astrid and Klara were not completely convinced, though. So we tossed other names around for while. At one point Klara suggested Cornelia and we all fell silent.
