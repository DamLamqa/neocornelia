## How to read the graph

Each person’s life span is represented by a bar. It’s shorter if they lived less, longer if they lived longer. It gets filled up with years passing by as they “consume” some of it. Each bar is annotated with the person’s name, gender, and profession if known.

The structures shown are families. Professional and godparenthood links can be toggled using the button in the bottom right corner

The initial view is “outside of time”. But that changes if you select a specific year on the slider to the right, as the graph updates to show the valid information at that point in time. People who have passed away, or who have not been born yet fade, relationships that have not yet happened or are no longer true also fade out

## What can you do with the graph?

Toggle the relationship buttons on the bottom right to view other co-existing links

Adjust the slider to select a year (The colored squares tell you which years have seen more action)

Hover over a person’s name to view more info about them

Hover over a professional/godparenthood link to get more info about the relationship
