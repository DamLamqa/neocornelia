###### About the 2019 call

2019 marks the fourth call for proposals within the Europeana Research Grants Programme and the first year with a call intended to support events. Embracing Europeana’s main mission to support cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformation, we decided to fund proposals for events that bring together cultural heritage professionals and researchers, such as conferences, workshops, seminar series and summer schools.

The theme of this year’s call was Digital Cultural Heritage for Open Science, which we felt offered valuable food for thought about the limits and potential of the reuse of digital collections as a source for research. Receiving over 70 proposals from all corners of the European Union showed that we were not wrong. The current debate related to Research and Innovation at the EU’s policy level increasingly puts in evidence the need to conceive research in the dimension of [Open Science](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy_en).

We were impressed with the quality of these proposals, as well with the genuine interest in co-organising an event with Europeana which many demonstrated. Researchers still seem to take the lead in projects related to acquiring and producing awareness of the value of digital cultural heritage, with 56.2 % of all proposals coming from universities and research institutes. However, the 19.2% of proposals which came from cultural heritage institutions make us hope that the number of applications from this sector will increase in the upcoming years.
