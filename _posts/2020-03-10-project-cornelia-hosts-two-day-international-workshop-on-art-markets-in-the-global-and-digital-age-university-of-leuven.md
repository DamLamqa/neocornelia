How can we reconcile and link powerful digital platforms so that art market and cultural heritage researchers can move beyond the case study approach to discover and analyze patterns that helps us to understand the worldwide circulation of both European and non-European art throughout the ages?

How can we transform new scholarly insights into widely accessible narratives and (virtual) exhibitions targeted at a wider audience?

These were the questions discussed by (in alphabetical order) Koenraad Brosens (KU Leuven), Laurens Dhaenens (KU Leuven), Anne Helmreich (Getty Research Institute), Christian Huemer (Belvedere Research Center, Vienna), Alba Irollo (Europeana Foundation), Antoine Isaac (Europeana Foundation), Florian Knother (Hong Kong University), Kim Oosterlinck (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles), Frederik Truyen (KU Leuven), Sandra van Ginhoven (Getty Research Institute), Katrien Verbert (KU Leuven), and Filip Vermeylen (Erasmus University Rotterdam).

The public conversation at the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts scheduled on 12 March was cancelled because of COVID-19.
